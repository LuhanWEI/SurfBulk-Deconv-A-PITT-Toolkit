# SurfBulk-Deconv
SurfBulk-Deconv: a unified electro-optical transient deconvolution code for redox-active oxides. Jointly fits ion-insertion current &amp; absorbance to derive surface rate k, bulk diffusion D, Biot number Bi, and surface-layer thickness, distinguishing pseudocapacitive vs bulk storage in electrodes; extends traditional PITT via cross-validation.
